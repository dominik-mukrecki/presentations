# Introduction & Motivation

::content::

- 1 in 3 people with ASD are minimally verbal or non-verbal
- Traditional interventions depend on spoken language
- Non-verbal individuals are underserved
- Aim: Safer, more predictive, and personalized support

---
layout: two-cols
---

::left-title::

### The Challenge

::left-content::

- Non-verbal status = hard to communicate distress/needs
- Meltdowns/anxiety hard to predict or prevent
- Diagnostics/therapies are language-centric

::right-title::

### The Opportunity

::right-content::

- Use digital simulation to “mirror” individual behavior
- Predict challenging scenarios in advance
- Support clinicians/caregivers with foresight

# State of the Art & Gaps

---
layout: two-cols
---

::left-title::

### Current Tools

::left-content::

- VR, games, and digital tools for ASD
- ML tools for event prediction
- Standard diagnostics (ADOS, CARS)

::right-title::

### Gaps & Limitations

::right-content::

- Most tech assumes verbal engagement
- Existing tools predict but don’t simulate lived behavior
- No dynamic adaptation to individual

## Three Core Components

::left-title::

### 2. RL Agent

::left-content::

- Learns in virtual environment
- State = sensory/routine/anxiety
- Actions = self-stimulation, avoidance, minimal communication

::right-title::

### 1. Sensory Overload Module

::right-content::

- Numeric thresholds for sensory triggers
- Individualized
- Continuous feedback with RL
todo, sens. overload + deprivation, expl.
more graphical
finite state machine?
transition function? markov chains - not determinist.
terms from the article - anxiety etc.
encyclopedia of autism - eg. tantrums

### 3. Human Calibration

::content::

- Human-in-the-loop adjustment
- Ongoing refinement via caregiver/therapist input
- Builds model fidelity and realism

all 3 component on the 1 slide, next 3 to explain todo

4 avatars - one random simulated npc, one ASD, one neurotypical captured from human, one simulated ASD

bulk of knowledge? library? sum of experience - to adjust, finetune models

behaviour as a mixture of different patterns

Insistince on Samensess - most promminent in ASD

### 3. caregiver Calibration

- Human-in-the-loop adjustment
- Ongoing refinement via caregiver/therapist input
- Builds model trust and realism

## Scenario Walkthrough

::content::

- E.g., crowded mall scenario
- Rising noise/crowd triggers
- RL selects retreat/self-soothing actions
- caregiver feedback tunes the model

maybe get video from Sora - check license first

todo

map behaviour from real child onto model - by adjusting parameters

more models, exposing them to evaluation, qualitive

sutton - model-free

# Validation Strategy

---
layout: two-cols
---

::left-title::

### Qualitative Phases

::left-content::

- Expert review: clinicians rate realism
- caregiver feedback: practical validation

::right-title::

### Quantitative Phases

::right-content::

- Compare outputs to ADOS-2, CARS, ADI-R etc.
- Longitudinal prediction: can the twin anticipate real-life meltdowns?

# Early Insights

---
layout: two-cols
---

::left-title::

### What We Hypothesise

::left-content::

- Simulated behavior could mirror real life experience
- all advantages of simulation could be explored and evaluated

::right-title::

### Possible Clinical Value

::right-content::

- More confidence in planning new scenarios
- "we can be brave now"
- Personalized, iterative improvement
- improve QOL patients...
- less ethical constrains in the venv

### Clinical/Tech Impact

::left-content::

- Personalized therapy
- Platform for assistive tech/robotics
- Toward smart, adaptive care
- 3/4 at least P personalized, Predictive, Preventive, Personalized, and Participatory???

### Next Steps

::right-content::

- Broader validation, more digital twins NDDs
- Add emotion/physio modeling
- Focus on usability & privacy - issue? compliance in the future? GPDR, HIPPA
