## Theoretical Framework

::content::

The current work is designed to serve as a theoretical basis for my planned PhD research.

This framework is necessary because we work with **real** children and adolescents, so we must be as careful as possible **to avoid causing them any harm**.

# Psychiatry Introduction

::title::

## How can we describe psychiatry?

::content::

Psychiatry is a branch of medical science and practice focused on improving the mental condition of an individual (or an entire population), based on:

- The experience of medical and psychological professionals  
  *(easiest to adopt, hardest to reproduce)*  
  **Example:** Sigmund Freud's work

- Empirical scientific models  
  *(the majority; preferred by Evidence-Based Medicine/Psychology)*  
  **Example:** Classical (Pavlov's) or operant (Skinner's) conditioning

- Formal scientific models  
  *(very narrow adoption so far, but already proven in some cases)*  
  **Example:** Hodgkin and Huxley model (cell membrane as an RC circuit)

## Skinner's Operant Conditioning Box

::content::

Skinner's box demonstrates operant conditioning, where behaviors (e.g., lever pressing) are shaped through rewards or punishments. This concept is foundational for modern behavioral therapies.

## Hodgkin-Huxley RC Cell Membrane Model

::content::

The Hodgkin-Huxley model represents the neuron's membrane as an electrical circuit (RC circuit), where ion channels act as resistors and the membrane functions as a capacitor. This framework explains how action potentials are generated and propagated, and forms the basis of modern neurophysiology.

## How can we describe autism?

::content::

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with unknown cause and heterogeneous traits, particularly:
- Difficulties in social interactions
- Repetitive, restrictive behaviors
- Insistence on sameness
- Fixations or intense interests
- Sudden-onset violent outbursts or tantrums
- Difficulties in verbal communication at varying levels

# Framework Overview

layout: two-cols

::left-title::

## Existing Solutions

::left-content::

- ASRS – Autism Spectrum Rating Scales
- ADOS-2 – Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, 2nd Edition
- ADI-R – Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised
- Biofeedback EEG therapy
- Sensory integration therapy
- Neurologopedic therapy
- Typical *spoken* psychotherapy
- Psychotropic medications to reduce aggression and anxiety

::right-title::

## Their Limitations

::right-content::

- **Almost every tool requires some level of verbal interaction!**
- Medications are often prescribed using a *trial-and-error* approach
- Speech development is perceived as *all-or-nothing* for future prognosis
- Each procedure requires experienced and certified personnel

## Digital Twin Concept

### Observation and Prediction

::left-content::

- Observe patients
- Map their behavior using motion capture
- Classification and prediction
- Observations tied to the individual’s timeline

::right-title::

### Simulation

::right-content::

- Reproduction of observed behaviors
- Rewarding **typical** autistic traits
- Penalizing *sensory overload*
- Simulation **without** direct observation
- Extending the timeline using computational resources

## Planned Study Phases

::content::

1. Observation of selected patients from psychiatric practice
2. Capture of their behavior and mapping it onto a virtual environment
3. Simulation of artificial individual behavior in the same environment
4. Qualitative studies — inspired by the Rosenhan experiment (experts review both captured and simulated individuals inside the virtual environment)
5. Quantitative studies — **autism spectrum** measurement of artificial individuals

**Research goal:**

Ability to simulate autistic behavior in a given virtual environment.

## Future Perspectives

::content::

1. Creating diagnostic tools using VR/XR
2. Developing novel therapies
3. Robotic assistants for autistic individuals
4. Discovering new methods—beyond spoken language—to communicate with non-verbal autistic individuals

# Summary

::content::

We know our plan is ambitious.

It is better to aim high and fail than to remain in a safe comfort zone.

Worst-case scenario: Even if this project fails completely, we do not risk children's mental health -- because simulations come first, before any real treatment.

If we achieve some success, we have the potential to improve the quality of life for one-third of autistic individuals, support their parents, and reduce social costs.

# Thank You

It was a pleasure to present my topic to the PhD Colloquium audience.

I hope to see you next year and to be able to show you work in progress.
