# Digital Twin for Non-Verbal Autism

Modeling and simulating behavior through reinforcement learning, sensory profiling, and caregiver feedback.

## Motivation

- Approximately one-third of autistic individuals are minimally or non-verbal.
- Traditional interventions rely heavily on verbal interaction.
- Trial-and-error therapy approaches can be ineffective and burdensome for caregivers.

## Proposed Solution

A **Digital Twin** platform that simulates individual behavior based on:

- Deep reinforcement learning.
- Sensory overload modeling.
- Caregiver-in-the-loop calibration.

## How It Works

- **State space**: sensory input, routine changes, anxiety levels.
- **Action space**: stimming, avoidance, nonverbal cues.
- **Reward**: reduce overload and anxiety.

## Platform, Not Just a Model

The **Digital Twin** serves as a flexible **testing ground** for:

- Multiple behavior models.
- Therapist and caregiver strategies.
- Human-agent interactions.

## Verification Strategy

1. **Expert review**: clinical realism.
2. **Caregiver usability**: practical feedback.
3. **Comparative evaluation**: against tools like ADOS-2, CARS.
4. **Longitudinal tracking**: real-world behavior updates.

## Applications and Impact

- Personalized non-verbal behavior simulation.
- Safer therapy design.
- Support for robotic caregivers.

## Next Steps

- Present at ANNSIM 2025.
- **Start a PhD**
- Participate in HealthTech Synergy Hub?
- Develop formal validation metrics (insistince on sameness, anxiety, sensory overload and others).
- Integrate with robotic agents (Nvidia Omniverse, Isaac GR00T N1).
