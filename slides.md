# Why Focus on ASD and ADHD?

- Common disorders: ASD (~1 in 36), ADHD (5–8% of children).
- Significant lifelong impacts on communication, attention, and social skills.
- High overlap and shared characteristics.

**My clinical background:** Primarily working with children and adolescents with high-functioning ASD, ADHD, or both.

<!--
In this seminar, we're focusing specifically on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) because these disorders are very common, affecting many children worldwide—about 1 in 36 children for ASD and between 5% and 8% for ADHD. Both disorders significantly impact daily life, affecting communication, attention, social skills, and academic achievement. Another reason for our focus is that these disorders often coexist, sharing similar features and underlying neurodevelopmental processes. From my own clinical experience, I've primarily worked with children and adolescents who have high-functioning autism, ADHD, or a combination of both. This has given me unique insights into the challenges and practical approaches to effectively manage and treat these conditions.

# Understanding "Stimulation"

<!--
Now, let's clarify what we mean by "stimulation," as it's central to today's topic. In this context, stimulation refers to methods and techniques that activate, enhance, or modulate neural and behavioral responses. Depending on the perspective—be it neuroscience, behaviorism, or biocybernetics—the concept of stimulation takes on different meanings and applications. Over the next few slides, we'll break down these perspectives and see exactly how each informs our approaches to diagnosing and treating neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Neuroscience Perspective

::left-title::

### Basic Concepts

::left-content::

- Physical stimuli detected by neural receptors.
- Stimuli converted (transduction) to neural signals.
- Brain processes and interprets these signals.

**Example:** Visual pathway: eye → retina → visual cortex.

::right-title::

### Clinical Importance

::right-content::

- Diagnostics: EEG, sensory evoked potentials.
- Treatments: Neuromodulation (TMS, tDCS).

<!--
From a neuroscience viewpoint, stimulation involves how physical inputs—like light, sound, or touch—are detected by specialized neural receptors throughout our bodies. These receptors convert, or transduce, these external stimuli into electrical signals. Those signals travel through nerve pathways to specific brain regions where they're processed and interpreted, resulting in perception or action. For example, when we see something, light enters the eye, hits the retina, and is converted into neural signals sent to the visual cortex.
Clinically, this concept of stimulation is essential. For diagnosis, techniques like EEG or sensory evoked potentials measure how the brain responds to various stimuli, helping identify abnormalities. For treatment, methods such as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) directly modulate neural activity, aiming to restore balance or improve specific brain functions in disorders like ASD or ADHD.

::content::

An EEG records electrical activity of the brain, capturing patterns like alpha, beta, and delta waves. It's crucial for diagnosing neurological conditions and guiding neurofeedback therapies.

<!--
Here you see a typical EEG recording showing different brain-wave patterns—alpha, beta, theta, and delta waves. Each wave type corresponds to distinct mental states:
Alpha waves usually occur when you're awake but relaxed, like quietly resting with eyes closed.
Beta waves are faster, associated with active thinking, problem-solving, and alertness—typically what you'd see during focused tasks.
Theta waves appear during light sleep, drowsiness, deep relaxation, or meditation, but can also indicate reduced alertness in awake states.
Delta waves, the slowest, dominate deep sleep and can indicate certain neurological conditions if present during wakefulness.
Clinically, analyzing these patterns helps identify issues like attention deficits, sleep disturbances, or seizure disorders, and guides interventions such as neurofeedback therapy, where individuals train to produce healthier brain-wave patterns.

## Behavioral Perspective (Pavlov & Skinner)

::left-title::

### Classical Conditioning (Pavlov)

::left-content::

- Learning by pairing neutral and unconditioned stimuli.
- Example: Bell sound paired with food → dog salivation.


::right-title::

### Operant Conditioning (Skinner)

::right-content::

- Learning through reinforcement or punishment.
- Example: Rat presses lever for food reward.


<!--
From a behavioral perspective, "stimulation" refers to environmental cues or events that shape our behaviors through learning. Two foundational concepts here are classical and operant conditioning.
In classical conditioning, first studied by Ivan Pavlov, learning occurs by pairing a neutral stimulus (like a bell) with an unconditioned stimulus (such as food), eventually leading the subject (like Pavlov's dog) to respond reflexively to the previously neutral stimulus alone—salivating at just the sound of the bell.
On the other hand, operant conditioning, introduced by B.F. Skinner, involves learning behaviors through reinforcement (reward) or punishment. For example, a rat learns to press a lever because it receives food, reinforcing the behavior.
These principles guide behavioral therapies widely used today, particularly effective in managing behaviors associated with ASD and ADHD by systematically reinforcing desired behaviors and reducing unwanted ones.

## Skinner's Operant Conditioning Box

::content::

Skinner's box demonstrates operant conditioning, where behaviors (e.g., lever pressing) are shaped through rewards or punishments, foundational for modern behavioral therapies.

<!--
This image shows a classic example of operant conditioning known as "Skinner's box." In this carefully controlled environment, animals like rats or pigeons learn specific behaviors, such as pressing a lever, because they receive rewards (like food pellets) or avoid punishments. Skinner used these boxes to demonstrate how behaviors are shaped systematically through consequences. This fundamental concept underlies many modern behavioral therapies, especially those used in treating conditions like autism and ADHD, helping individuals learn beneficial behaviors and reduce problematic ones through structured reinforcement.

## Pavlov's Classical Conditioning

::content::

Pavlov's experiment showed how neutral stimuli (like a bell) paired with food could trigger conditioned responses (salivation), forming the basis for behavior modification techniques.

<!--
This image illustrates Ivan Pavlov's famous classical conditioning experiment. Pavlov discovered that dogs naturally salivated in response to food—an unconditioned stimulus. He then paired this food repeatedly with a neutral stimulus, a bell sound. Eventually, the dogs began salivating at the sound of the bell alone, without food. This conditioned response demonstrated how learning through association occurs. Classical conditioning has become foundational in behavioral therapies, especially in interventions aiming to modify responses and behaviors in individuals with conditions like ASD and ADHD.

## Biocybernetics Perspective (Feedback Control)

::left-title::

### Key Principles

::left-content::

- Biological systems regulated by feedback loops.
- Adjustments aimed at maintaining balance (homeostasis).
- Example: Blood glucose controlled via insulin and glucagon.

::right-title::

### Clinical Applications

::right-content::

- Real-time adjustments via closed-loop stimulation.
- Example: Neurostimulation guided by EEG feedback.


<!--
From a biocybernetics viewpoint, stimulation is understood through the lens of feedback and control mechanisms. Biological systems naturally use feedback loops to maintain stability or homeostasis, constantly adjusting internal conditions. A classic example is how the body maintains blood glucose levels: when glucose rises, insulin is released to lower it; when glucose drops, glucagon raises it again.
Clinically, this feedback principle inspires real-time therapeutic methods such as closed-loop neurostimulation. For example, using EEG signals, we can provide instant feedback on brain activity, allowing precise adjustments in stimulation. This approach can help individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD or ADHD regulate brain functions effectively, guiding their brains toward healthier, more balanced states.

::title::

## Glucose Regulation via Feedback Loop

::content::

Insulin and glucagon maintain blood glucose balance. High glucose triggers insulin release (lowering glucose), while low glucose prompts glucagon release (raising glucose), exemplifying biocybernetic feedback control.

<!--
This image illustrates how blood glucose levels are regulated through a natural feedback loop—an excellent example of biocybernetics in action. When blood glucose rises, such as after a meal, insulin is released from the pancreas, helping cells absorb glucose and thus lowering blood sugar. Conversely, when blood glucose levels drop too low, glucagon is released, signaling the liver to release stored glucose back into the bloodstream. This constant balancing act maintains homeostasis. In therapy, similar feedback control principles are applied in real-time brain stimulation techniques, such as EEG neurofeedback, to help individuals self-regulate brain activity effectively.

|-------------|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Focus       | Neural pathways        | Learned behaviors         | Feedback systems         |
| Method      | Bottom-up              | Stimulus-response         | Top-down                 |
| Example     | Reflexive responses    | Pavlov’s conditioning     | Temperature regulation   |
| Application | Neurotherapies         | Behavioral modification   | Adaptive technologies    |

<!--
This slide summarizes the three perspectives we've discussed—Neuroscience, Behaviorism, and Biocybernetics—comparing their distinct yet complementary approaches to understanding stimulation.
Neuroscience takes a bottom-up approach, focusing directly on neural pathways and reflexive responses, such as measuring brain activity in response to stimuli. It underpins neurotherapies like TMS and EEG-guided interventions.
Behaviorism emphasizes a stimulus-response model, shaping behavior through conditioning techniques like Pavlov's experiments. It's fundamental to behavior modification therapies widely used in clinical practice.
Biocybernetics adopts a top-down, systems-level view, emphasizing feedback loops and adaptive control, as seen in temperature or glucose regulation. This perspective informs adaptive technologies such as neurofeedback and closed-loop brain stimulation.
Together, these three perspectives provide a comprehensive framework for effective diagnosis and treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD and ADHD.

::header::

## ASD Clinical & Biological Insights

::left-title::

### Clinical Features

::left-content::

- Impaired social interactions
- Repetitive behaviors, rigidity ("Insistence on Sameness")
- Communication difficulties


::right-title::

### Neurobiological Insights

::right-content::

- Imbalance in GABA/glutamate systems
- Atypical neural connectivity


<!--
Autism Spectrum Disorder, or ASD, is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by challenges in social communication and interaction, repetitive behaviors, and rigid adherence to routines, often described as "insistence on sameness." Clinically, individuals with ASD might find it difficult to interpret social cues, maintain eye contact, or participate comfortably in social settings.
From a biological standpoint, ASD has been associated with an imbalance in certain neurotransmitter systems, particularly involving GABA and glutamate, critical for regulating brain activity. There's also evidence of atypical connectivity patterns between different brain regions, meaning the way different parts of the brain communicate might be disrupted or inefficient.
Understanding both the clinical presentation and the underlying neurobiology of ASD is vital because it helps us develop targeted interventions, including stimulation-based therapies that aim to enhance social engagement and cognitive flexibility.

## ADHD Clinical & Biological Insights

::left-title::

### Clinical Presentation

::left-content::

- Attention deficits
- Impulsivity, hyperactivity
- Academic and social impairments


::right-title::

### Neurobiology

::right-content::

- Dopamine/norepinephrine dysregulation
- Frontal-striatal dysfunctions


<!--
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD, is a neurodevelopmental condition marked by persistent attention difficulties, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Clinically, individuals with ADHD often struggle with maintaining focus, become easily distracted, or frequently interrupt others. These challenges can significantly affect academic performance, social interactions, and everyday functioning.
From a neurobiological standpoint, ADHD has been linked to dysregulation of key neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine and norepinephrine, which play critical roles in attention, motivation, and executive functions. Additionally, research has identified dysfunctions within the frontal-striatal brain circuits—areas essential for controlling impulses, decision-making, and attention.
Understanding the clinical and neurobiological aspects of ADHD helps clinicians and researchers develop targeted interventions—such as medication, cognitive-behavioral strategies, and emerging neuromodulation therapies—to effectively support individuals living with ADHD.

# Neuromodulation Techniques: TMS & tDCS

<!--
Now, let's dive into two exciting neuromodulation techniques—Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). These methods directly target brain activity, using magnetic or electrical stimulation to modulate neural circuits. They're increasingly explored as promising tools for diagnosing and treating neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD and ADHD, offering new hope for effective interventions. Let's explore each in more detail.

## Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)

::left-title::

### Diagnostic Potential

::left-content::

- Measures cortical inhibition (ADHD)
- Reveals cortical plasticity issues (ASD)


::right-title::

### Therapeutic Uses

::right-content::

- Reduces repetitive behaviors in ASD
- Improves attention in ADHD


<!--
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, or TMS, is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique that uses magnetic pulses to stimulate specific brain regions. Diagnostically, TMS can measure cortical inhibition, which is often disrupted in ADHD, and it also helps reveal abnormalities in cortical plasticity typically seen in ASD.
Therapeutically, repetitive TMS has shown promise in reducing repetitive and restrictive behaviors in autism, enhancing social interaction, and alleviating core symptoms. In ADHD, targeted TMS treatment to frontal brain regions has demonstrated improvements in attention, impulse control, and executive function. These promising results highlight TMS as a valuable diagnostic tool and an emerging therapeutic option for neurodevelopmental disorders.

::title::

## TMS Explained

::content::

When a TMS pulse is applied to the motor cortex, it elicits TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs), descending volleys, and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). TEPs are recorded through electroencephalography (EEG) and reflect the activation of specific excitatory and inhibitory neural circuits. Descending volleys represent the direct and indirect activation of corticospinal neurons, and MEPs are recorded from peripheral muscles, indicating the functional integrity of the corticospinal tract.

<!--
This image clearly illustrates how Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, or TMS, works. When we place the magnetic coil over the motor cortex and deliver a pulse, it activates neurons in the brain, creating a chain reaction. This generates TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs), which we can measure using EEG—showing us precisely which brain circuits are activated or inhibited. At the same time, these pulses generate descending volleys—electrical signals traveling down the spinal cord—and result in motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), which we record from peripheral muscles. By analyzing these responses, we can assess the functional integrity and responsiveness of the brain's motor pathways, which is particularly valuable in diagnosing and understanding neurodevelopmental disorders.

## TMS-EEG Design Framework

::content::

- **TMS Input Parameters:** Determining the stimulation location (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), selecting the appropriate protocol (such as single-pulse or repetitive TMS), and setting the timing of stimulation.

- **EEG Output Parameters:** Choosing electrode placement, defining the measures to be recorded (like amplitude or latency of evoked potentials), and scheduling the timing of EEG recordings in relation to TMS pulses.

- **Brain State Considerations:** Accounting for factors such as the participant's developmental stage, behavioral context, dynamic brain states, and any underlying neurological conditions to tailor the study design effectively.
<!--
This slide outlines the structured framework for designing combined TMS-EEG studies. First, we define TMS input parameters, such as where precisely to stimulate the brain (often the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), the specific type of stimulation (single-pulse or repetitive), and when to deliver these pulses. Next, we specify EEG output parameters, deciding on electrode placement, selecting what EEG features to measure—like amplitude or latency—and scheduling recordings to effectively capture responses following TMS pulses. Finally, it's crucial to consider the individual's brain state, including developmental stage, behavioral context, current mental state, and existing neurological conditions. These considerations allow researchers and clinicians to tailor the intervention and ensure optimal effectiveness for each person.

## Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)

::left-title::

### ASD Treatment

::left-content::

- Enhances social skills, empathy
- Long-term safety demonstrated


::right-title::

### ADHD Treatment

::right-content::

- Boosts executive functions, attention
- Safe for children/adolescents


<!--
Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, or tDCS, is another exciting neuromodulation technique. It involves applying a low-intensity electrical current directly to specific brain regions through electrodes placed on the scalp.
For individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), recent research indicates that tDCS can enhance social skills and empathy. Studies have also demonstrated its safety and potential effectiveness over the long term, making it a promising therapeutic tool.
Similarly, in ADHD, tDCS shows significant promise by enhancing executive functions like inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, and attention. Importantly, research indicates it is safe for use even in children and adolescents, highlighting its potential as a valuable, non-invasive treatment option alongside traditional methods.

## Polarisation in TMS

::content::

Depolarisation (D) occurs when current flows parallel to the somatodendritic axis from dendrite to soma (radial inward), hyperpolarisation (H) when current flows soma to dendrite (radial outward), and little to no polarisation when current is orthogonal to the somatodendritic axis of the neuron (tangential).

<!--
This image illustrates the polarization effects observed during TMS, showing how different directions of current flow affect neuronal activity. Specifically, depolarization occurs when current flows inward along the neuron—from dendrite to soma—enhancing neuronal activity. In contrast, hyperpolarization happens when current flows outward—from soma to dendrite—reducing neuron excitability. When current is tangential or perpendicular to the neuron’s axis, minimal or no polarization occurs. Understanding these polarization principles helps optimize TMS protocols, ensuring we effectively target and modulate specific brain circuits for therapeutic outcomes.

## tDCS Current Flow Modelling

::content::

1. Structural MRI
2. Tissues segmentation
3. Electrodes positioning
4. Finite element model for E-field distribution solving
5. Grey and white matter surfaces mesh creating
6. E-field vectors vectors extracting...
7. ...and averaging.

<!--
This slide describes the step-by-step process for modeling current flow in tDCS treatments. First, we start by taking structural MRI scans to visualize brain anatomy. Next, we segment the MRI data into different tissue types—like skin, bone, and brain—to precisely understand how current will travel through each tissue. Then we position the electrodes strategically based on our therapeutic goals. Using advanced computational techniques, we solve finite element models to predict how electrical fields distribute within the brain. From there, we create detailed meshes of the brain’s grey and white matter surfaces to accurately map current pathways. We extract electric-field vectors to see precisely how the current is directed, and finally, we average these data to optimize and tailor stimulation protocols for each individual's unique brain structure, enhancing treatment effectiveness and safety.

Peripheral nerve stimulation includes two promising non-invasive techniques—Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (TNS) and Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS). TNS is FDA-approved for ADHD, improving attention and reducing hyperactivity safely and effectively, even in young populations. On the other side, VNS—particularly through the non-invasive auricular method—has shown potential in addressing anxiety and enhancing social behaviors in individuals with autism. Although evidence for VNS remains preliminary, these techniques collectively represent important advances towards personalized, non-invasive treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders.

This diagram illustrates invasive versus non-invasive forms of vagus nerve stimulation. Non-invasive transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) targets the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (ABVN) by placing electrodes externally on the ear, typically on the cymba concha or tragus.

<!--
In contrast, this figure depicts non-invasive transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation, or taVNS. Unlike invasive methods requiring surgery, taVNS uses externally placed electrodes on specific ear regions, such as the tragus or cymba concha. This method effectively modulates parasympathetic nervous activity and is currently being studied as a promising treatment for anxiety and social communication difficulties, especially in individuals with autism spectrum disorders. Preliminary results are encouraging, highlighting its potential for broad clinical application.

<!--
EEG Neurofeedback, also known simply as neurofeedback, is a powerful technique that allows individuals to directly influence their own brain activity.

For ADHD, extensive research shows significant benefits, particularly in improving attention and reducing hyperactivity. Some studies even suggest that its effectiveness is comparable to medication treatments, making it a compelling alternative or complement to traditional therapies.

In the case of ASD, neurofeedback shows promising potential, especially in enhancing cognitive flexibility and attention. However, current evidence for addressing core ASD symptoms—such as social interaction difficulties—is still developing and requires further research. Overall, neurofeedback represents an exciting approach to empower individuals to actively participate in managing their neurological condition.

A diagram presenting the neurofeedback training loop.

<!--
This diagram illustrates the neurofeedback training loop clearly. The process begins with EEG sensors recording the individual's real-time brain activity. These signals are translated into visual or auditory feedback, allowing the person to directly observe their brain function. The participant then consciously adjusts their mental state or behavior, aiming to produce desired brainwave patterns. This continuous cycle—brain activity measurement, immediate feedback, and conscious adjustment—allows individuals to gradually learn and reinforce healthier neural patterns, significantly improving cognitive functions like attention, focus, and emotional regulation.

<!--
Virtual Reality (VR) is an exciting technology increasingly used in therapy for neurodevelopmental disorders.
For Autism Spectrum Disorder, VR provides immersive environments to effectively teach social skills. Research indicates significant improvements in social interactions and empathy, particularly beneficial for individuals with high-functioning autism. By practicing social scenarios in a safe, controlled virtual space, participants build confidence and transferable skills.
For ADHD, VR techniques offer engaging platforms for improving attention and reducing impulsivity. Virtual classrooms simulate realistic educational settings, allowing therapists to assess and train attention in a controlled yet engaging environment. This realistic approach helps individuals with ADHD develop stronger cognitive control, better focus, and effective management of impulsive behaviors.

## ANNSIM PhD Colloqium -- Madrid 2025

::content::

- **Challenge:** Complexity and individuality of non-verbal ASD behaviors.
- **Solution:** Personalized simulation via Digital Twin technology.
- **Approach:** Integration of sensor and video data with machine learning and simulation (Agent-Based Modeling, Reinforcement Learning).
- **Challenges:** Ensuring data quality, privacy concerns, ethical considerations.
- **Benefits:** Improved prediction of behaviors, personalized therapy, enhanced caregiver preparedness.
- **Next Steps:** Model refinement, clinical validation, real-world application trials.

<!--
In this concept, I address the significant challenges in understanding and supporting individuals with non-verbal Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Given the complex and unique nature of ASD behaviors, standard interventions are often insufficient. To tackle this, I've proposed a digital twin approach, creating personalized virtual replicas that simulate the individual's behaviors based on detailed sensor and video data. This allows us to predict behaviors more accurately, tailor interventions precisely, and better prepare caregivers. Of course, challenges remain, particularly in ensuring data privacy, quality, and ethics. Moving forward, I aim to refine the simulation models through clinical validation and real-world testing, collaborating closely with caregivers and specialists.
