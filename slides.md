# Welcome to the Seminar!

::content::

Today, we’ll explore how stimulation-based methods from neuroscience, behaviorism, and biocybernetics can improve the diagnosis and treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders, with a special focus on **ASD and ADHD**.

Let’s dive in!

::content::

# Why Focus on ASD and ADHD?

- Common disorders: ASD (~1 in 36), ADHD (5–8% of children).
- Significant lifelong impacts on communication, attention, and social skills.
- High overlap and shared characteristics.

**My clinical background:** Primarily working with children and adolescents with high-functioning ASD, ADHD, or both.

# Understanding "Stimulation"

---
layout: two-cols-header
---

::header::

## Neuroscience Perspective

::left-title::

### Basic Concepts

::left-content::

- Physical stimuli detected by neural receptors.
- Stimuli converted (transduction) to neural signals.
- Brain processes and interprets these signals.

**Example:** Visual pathway: eye → retina → visual cortex.

::right-title::

### Clinical Importance

::right-content::

- Diagnostics: EEG, sensory evoked potentials.
- Treatments: Neuromodulation (TMS, tDCS).

## Behavioral Perspective (Pavlov & Skinner)

::left-title::

### Classical Conditioning (Pavlov)

::left-content::

- Learning by pairing neutral and unconditioned stimuli.
- Example: Bell sound paired with food → dog salivation.

[Rescorla, R. A. (2008). *Classical Conditioning*.](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-012370509-9.00127-2)

::right-title::

### Operant Conditioning (Skinner)

::right-content::

- Learning through reinforcement or punishment.
- Example: Rat presses lever for food reward.

[Skinner, B. F. (1938). *The Behavior of Organisms*.](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.191112)

## Skinner's Operant Conditioning Box

::content::

Skinner's box demonstrates operant conditioning, where behaviors (e.g., lever pressing) are shaped through rewards or punishments, foundational for modern behavioral therapies.

## Pavlov's Classical Conditioning

::content::

Pavlov's experiment showed how neutral stimuli (like a bell) paired with food could trigger conditioned responses (salivation), forming the basis for behavior modification techniques.

::header::

## Biocybernetics Perspective (Feedback Control)

::left-title::

### Key Principles

::left-content::

- Biological systems regulated by feedback loops.
- Adjustments aimed at maintaining balance (homeostasis).
- Example: Blood glucose controlled via insulin and glucagon.

::right-title::

### Clinical Applications

::right-content::

- Real-time adjustments via closed-loop stimulation.
- Example: Neurostimulation guided by EEG feedback.

[Wiener, N. (1948). *Cybernetics*.](https://archive.org/details/cyberneticsorcon00wien)

## Glucose Regulation via Feedback Loop

::content::

Insulin and glucagon maintain blood glucose balance. High glucose triggers insulin release (lowering glucose), while low glucose prompts glucagon release (raising glucose), exemplifying biocybernetic feedback control.

::title::

## TMS Explained

::content::

When a TMS pulse is applied to the motor cortex, it elicits TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs), descending volleys, and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). TEPs are recorded through electroencephalography (EEG) and reflect the activation of specific excitatory and inhibitory neural circuits. Descending volleys represent the direct and indirect activation of corticospinal neurons, and MEPs are recorded from peripheral muscles, indicating the functional integrity of the corticospinal tract.

## TMS-EEG Design Framework

::content::

- **TMS Input Parameters:** Determining the stimulation location (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), selecting the appropriate protocol (such as single-pulse or repetitive TMS), and setting the timing of stimulation.

- **EEG Output Parameters:** Choosing electrode placement, defining the measures to be recorded (like amplitude or latency of evoked potentials), and scheduling the timing of EEG recordings in relation to TMS pulses.

- **Brain State Considerations:** Accounting for factors such as the participant's developmental stage, behavioral context, dynamic brain states, and any underlying neurological conditions to tailor the study design effectively.[Farzan, Faranak et al. “Characterizing and Modulating Brain Circuitry through Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Combined with Electroencephalography.” Frontiers in neural circuits vol. 10 73. 22 Sep. 2016](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncir.2016.00073)

## Polarisation in TMS

::content::

Depolarisation (D) occurs when current flows parallel to the somatodendritic axis from dendrite to soma (radial inward), hyperpolarisation (H) when current flows soma to dendrite (radial outward), and little to no polarisation when current is orthogonal to the somatodendritic axis of the neuron (tangential).
