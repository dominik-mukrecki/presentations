# Digital Twin for Non-Verbal Autism

Modeling and simulating behavior through reinforcement learning, sensory profiling, and caregiver feedback.

# Motivation

- Approximately one-third of autistic individuals are minimally or non-verbal.
- Traditional interventions rely heavily on verbal interaction.
- Trial-and-error therapy approaches can be ineffective and burdensome for caregivers.

# Proposed Solution

A **Digital Twin** platform that simulates individual behavior based on:

- Deep reinforcement learning.
- Sensory overload modeling.
- Caregiver-in-the-loop calibration.

# How It Works

- **State space**: sensory input, routine changes, anxiety levels.
- **Action space**: stimming, avoidance, nonverbal cues.
- **Reward**: reduce overload and anxiety.

# Platform, Not Just a Model

The **Digital Twin** serves as a flexible **testing ground** for:

- Multiple behavior models.
- Therapist and caregiver strategies.
- Human-agent interactions.

# Verification Strategy

1. **Expert review**: clinical realism.
2. **Caregiver usability**: practical feedback.
3. **Comparative evaluation**: against tools like ADOS-2, CARS.
4. **Longitudinal tracking**: real-world behavior updates.
