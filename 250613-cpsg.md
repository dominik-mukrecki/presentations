## Introduction

::content::

Welcome! This talk introduces the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and why it matters for psychiatry. We will bridge theoretical foundations with clinical insights, providing informatics PhD students with a computational view of mental disorders.

# Theoretical Foundations

::title::

### Self‑Organization and Surprise Minimization

::content::

Brains are self‑organizing systems that minimize surprise. Free energy provides an internal measure that bounds surprise, so minimizing free energy effectively minimizes prediction errors.

### The Bayesian Brain in Action

::content::

Under FEP, the brain performs Bayesian inference. Higher areas send predictions downward while lower areas convey prediction errors upward—an iterative predictive coding loop that refines beliefs about the world.

### Active Inference

::content::

Perception and action work together to minimize free energy. When sensory inputs don’t match predictions, we can either update beliefs or act to change the world so that it matches our expectations.

### False Inference as Pathology

::content::

Many psychiatric symptoms stem from faulty inference—misjudging the precision of predictions and sensory evidence. Neuromodulators like dopamine or NMDA receptors regulate this precision; their dysfunction can produce hallucinations or delusions.

### Schizophrenia: Aberrant Precision

::content::

Hallucinations and delusions may arise when top‑down predictions are overly precise or sensory errors are underweighted. Dysregulated synaptic gain (“dysconnection”) disrupts hierarchical message passing in the brain.

### Autism: Hypo‑Priors and Sensory Overload

::content::

In autism, prior beliefs may be weak relative to sensory precision. The result is heightened sensitivity to stimuli and difficulties integrating context, leading to sensory overload and detail‑focused cognition.

### Depression: Pessimistic Priors

::content::

Depression can be viewed as the brain settling on negative predictions about the world and the self. Low confidence in positive outcomes reduces exploration, reinforcing a hopeless worldview.

## Key Takeaways

::content::

- FEP unifies perception, action, and learning as free‑energy minimization.
- Psychiatric disorders can be framed as specific failures of inference.
- Computational models offer bridges between neuroscience and clinical practice.
