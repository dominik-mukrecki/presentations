## Gibbs Free Energy

::content::

At constant $T$ & $p$:  

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S
\end{aligned}
$$

* **ΔG &lt; 0** → spontaneous  
* **ΔG = 0** → equilibrium  
* **ΔG &gt; 0** → needs coupling

### Spontaneity Table

::content::

| ΔH | ΔS | Example | Spontaneous? |
|----|----|---------|--------------|
| –  | +  | Combustion | Always |
| –  | –  | Water freezing | Only at low T |
| +  | +  | Ice melting | Only at high T |
| +  | –  | ADP + Pi → ATP | Never |

### Why ΔG↓ but Entropy↑?

::content::

Heat released increases **surroundings S** more than ordering lowers **system S**.  
Net effect: **total entropy rises** while free energy falls.

## *Weird* Lactase as an *Agent*

::content::

```matlab
% pseudocode

get current state

% lactose = 100, glucose = 0, galactose = 0 => entropy local min

while (lactose > 0 and G > local min and S < local max)

   get lactose molecule
   adapt your shape to fit lactose (you have learned it during protein folding, remember!)
   get water molecule
   use it to break O-glycosidic bond
   release glucose and galactose molecules

get current state

% lactose = 90, glucose = 10, galactose = 10 => entropy local max, G local min not reached!
```

## General understanding

::content::

Function of adaptive agents is to minimize *surprises* by active predictions.

From biological level such a functionality needs more complex soultions than simple biologically pretrained protein agents.

But what if we are composed from myriads of them?
